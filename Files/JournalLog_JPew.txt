4/12:
tested for RTS at 10 kHz by setting nplc (line 74) to 0.001/60 and timeDelay (line 73) to 0.0001
tested for RTS at 5 kHz by setting nplc (line 74) to 0.01/60 and timeDelay (line 73) to 0.0002
tested for RTS at 1 kHz by setting nplc (line 74) to 0.05/60 and timeDelay (line 73) to 0.001
tested for RTS at 1 kHz by setting nplc (line 74) to 0.1/60 and timeDelay (line 73) to 0.002
Dropped the range for the RTS voltage measuerments to 1 V and saw a double gaussian 

To do:
fix Vgs label in graph



5/4:
changed save function to save csv of every row vs overwritting the save and concatinating new data. (saves time)

5/7:
change save funtion to .feather format vs .csv

5/8:
changed script to only plot signals with detected rts. 
	- Detection needs work because we don't plot all signals with rts
	- check to see if argrelmax(vOut['Vgs']) finds the same peaks it does with histogram.
		- np.histogram(rtsData['Vgs'], bins='auto') does the same as plt.hist without plotting


5/15:
changed from using argrelmax function to find rts amplitude in histogram to find_peaks.
	- setting width = 2 seems to remove most aliasing/undesired peaks.
	- setting height = 100 removes peaks less that have less than 100 points
started 10nA characterization of bank 1. Passing data collection to Jay.
changed the way rts amplitude is calculated
	- Finds the steady state voltage by finding the max y value for histogram
	- uses the steady state voltage to calculate multiple level rts
	- negative values means the rts shifted the voltage down
	- added a filter for the signal
		- produces more accurate histograms for amplitude calculations
		- switched back to width = 1 because filtered data removes the aliasing/unwanted peaks
