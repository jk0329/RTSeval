4/12:
tested for RTS at 10 kHz by setting nplc (line 74) to 0.001/60 and timeDelay (line 73) to 0.0001
tested for RTS at 5 kHz by setting nplc (line 74) to 0.01/60 and timeDelay (line 73) to 0.0002
tested for RTS at 1 kHz by setting nplc (line 74) to 0.05/60 and timeDelay (line 73) to 0.001
tested for RTS at 1 kHz by setting nplc (line 74) to 0.1/60 and timeDelay (line 73) to 0.002
Dropped the range for the RTS voltage measuerments to 1 V and saw a double gaussian 

To do:
fix Vgs label in graph
